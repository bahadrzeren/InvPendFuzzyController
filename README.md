Simulates and report behaviour of an Inverted Pendulum system under the control of four different fuzzy controllers.

Those are Fuzzy controller with:

1- Triangular membership functions.

2- Gaussian membership functions.

3- Gaussian membership functions that are generated through Standard Fuzzy Transfer using the dictionary.

4- Gaussian membership functions that are generated through Normalized Fuzzy Transfer using the dictionary.
