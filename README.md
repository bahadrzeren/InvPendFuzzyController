# InvPendFuzzyController

Simulates and report behaviour of an Inverted Pendulum system under the control of four different fuzzy controllers.

Those are fuzzy controllers that have:

- Triangular membership functions.
- Gaussian membership functions.
- Gaussian membership functions that are generated through Standard Fuzzy Transfer using the dictionary.
- Gaussian membership functions that are generated through Normalized Fuzzy Transfer using the dictionary.

Libraries used:

- Juzzy, http://juzzy.wagnerweb.net/
