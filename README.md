2- Fuzzy controller with gaussian membership functions.
3- Fuzzy controller with gaussian membership functions that are generated through Standard Fuzzy Transfer using the dictionary.
4- Fuzzy controller with gaussian membership functions that are generated through Normalized Fuzzy Transfer using the dictionary.
